When he completely wrapped a Crookes tube in black cardboard and applied electricity, he unexpectedly noticed a fluorescent screen coated with barium platinocyanide glowing several feet away. Even more astonishing, when he placed his hand in the path of the rays, the screen showed an image of his hand bones—this was the first time in human history that the inside of the body could be &quot;seen&quot; without surgery.</p><p>Röntgen named these unknown rays &quot;X-rays.&quot; On December 22, 1895, he took the first medical image in human history—an X-ray of his wife Anna Bertha&#39;s hand. When Anna saw the X-ray showing her hand bones and wedding ring, she exclaimed in shock: &quot;I have seen my death!&quot; This photograph marked the beginning of a new era in medical diagnosis.</p><figure><img src="'+o+'" alt="Anna Bertha&#39;s Hand X-ray" tabindex="0"><figcaption>Anna Bertha&#39;s Hand X-ray</figcaption></figure><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">🏆 Nobel Prize Glory</p><p>Röntgen received the first Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901 for his discovery of X-rays.

This is not only technological progress, but also humanity&#39;s relentless pursuit of the dream to &quot;see the invisible.&quot;</p><h3 id="🔬-phase-1-projection-imaging-era-1895-1970s" tabindex="-1">🔬 Phase 1: Projection Imaging Era (1895-1970s) <a class="header-anchor" href="#🔬-phase-1-projection-imaging-era-1895-1970s" aria-label="Permalink to “🔬 Phase 1: Projection Imaging Era (1895-1970s)”">​</a></h3><p><strong>The Golden Age of X-rays</strong></p><p>After Röntgen&#39;s discovery of X-rays, the technology spread at an astonishing rate. In 1896, just months after the discovery, X-ray machines were used on battlefields to locate bullets and shrapnel. However, early X-ray imaging faced a fundamental limitation: it was a <strong>projection imaging</strong> technique.</p><p>Imagine shining a flashlight on a complex three-dimensional object—the shadow on the wall compresses all depth information into a two-dimensional image. X-ray imaging works the same way—information from all tissues in the body is superimposed on a flat photograph. A lung tumor might be obscured by ribs, and a small lesion might be lost in the overlapping images of surrounding tissues.</p><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">⚠️ The Dilemma of Projection Imaging</p><p>Traditional X-ray photographs are like taking a photo of a thick book after flattening it—you can see all the text, but it&#39;s all overlapped, making it difficult to read each page&#39;s content.</p></div><h3 id="🎯-phase-2-tomographic-imaging-revolution-1970s-1990s" tabindex="-1">🎯 Phase 2: Tomographic Imaging Revolution (1970s-1990s) <a class="header-anchor" href="#🎯-phase-2-tomographic-imaging-revolution-1970s-1990s" aria-label="Permalink to “🎯 Phase 2: Tomographic Imaging Revolution (1970s-1990s)”">​</a></h3><p><strong>Hounsfield&#39;s Brilliant Idea</strong></p><p>In 1967, British engineer Godfrey Hounsfield at EMI began pondering a question: Could we reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of an object by taking X-ray photographs from multiple angles and using a computer? This seemingly simple idea required solving two enormous challenges:</p><ol><li><strong>Mathematical Problem</strong>: How to reconstruct the original three-dimensional image from multiple projections?</li><li><strong>Computational Challenge</strong>: In the 1960s, computer processing power was extremely limited</li></ol><p>Hounsfield spent five years combining the mathematical theory proposed by Austrian mathematician Johann Radon in 1917, and finally developed the world&#39;s first clinical CT scanner in 1971. The first scan took 5 minutes to acquire data, then 2.5 hours for image reconstruction—but the results were stunning: doctors could clearly see the internal structure of the brain for the first time without craniotomy.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">🎖️ World-Changing Invention</p><p>Hounsfield and South African physicist Allan Cormack, who independently developed CT theory, jointly received the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. CT technology has been hailed as &quot;the most important advance in radiology since Röntgen&#39;s discovery of X-rays.&quot;</p></div><p><strong>MRI: The Radiation-Free Revolution</strong></p><p>While CT technology was flourishing, another revolutionary technology was brewing. In 1973, American chemist Paul Lauterbur and British physicist Peter Mansfield almost simultaneously but independently proposed methods for imaging using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).</p><p>Unlike X-rays and CT, MRI does not use ionizing radiation but utilizes the resonance phenomenon of hydrogen nuclei in the human body in a strong magnetic field. It&#39;s like installing a tiny &quot;radio transmitter&quot; on every hydrogen atom in the body. By precisely adjusting the magnetic field, we can make hydrogen atoms at specific locations &quot;speak,&quot; thereby constructing images.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">💡 Why &quot;Magnetic Resonance&quot; Instead of &quot;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance&quot;?</p><p>This technology was originally called &quot;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging,&quot; but the word &quot;nuclear&quot; made the public associate it with nuclear radiation, causing unnecessary panic. Therefore, in clinical applications, it was renamed &quot;Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),&quot; although it has nothing to do with nuclear radiation.</p></div><p>MRI&#39;s advantage lies not only in being radiation-free but also in providing <strong>soft tissue contrast</strong> far superior to CT. Gray and white matter in the brain, different layers of muscle, early tumor lesions—structures difficult to distinguish on CT are clearly visible on MRI. Lauterbur and Mansfield received the 2003 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this achievement.</p><h3 id="🌈-phase-3-functional-and-molecular-imaging-era-1990s-present" tabindex="-1">🌈 Phase 3: Functional and Molecular Imaging Era (1990s-Present) <a class="header-anchor" href="#🌈-phase-3-functional-and-molecular-imaging-era-1990s-present" aria-label="Permalink to “🌈 Phase 3: Functional and Molecular Imaging Era (1990s-Present)”">​</a></h3><p><strong>From &quot;Seeing Structure&quot; to &quot;Seeing Function&quot;</strong></p><p>Entering the 21st century, medical imaging technology began to evolve from purely anatomical structure imaging to functional and molecular imaging:</p><ul><li><p><strong>PET (Positron Emission Tomography)</strong>: No longer satisfied with seeing the shape of tumors, but wanting to see their metabolic activity.
