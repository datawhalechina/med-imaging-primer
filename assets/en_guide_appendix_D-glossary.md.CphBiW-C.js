collected, through which images are generated by Fourier transform.</td></tr><tr><td>T1-weighted</td><td>A contrast method of MRI sequences, emphasizing longitudinal relaxation characteristics, with clear structure.</td></tr><tr><td>T2-weighted</td><td>Another contrast method of MRI sequences, emphasizing transverse relaxation characteristics, with obvious display of liquid/edema.</td></tr><tr><td>Windowing (Window Width/Level)</td><td>In CT or X-ray image display, used to adjust grayscale range and midpoint to optimize contrast.</td></tr><tr><td>Flat-field correction</td><td>Corrects dark spots or streak artifacts in images caused by detector/illumination non-uniformity or inconsistent response.</td></tr><tr><td>SENSE (Sensitivity Encoding)</td><td>MRI parallel imaging technique that uses multiple coil sensitivity information to achieve scanning acceleration.</td></tr><tr><td>Parallel Imaging</td><td>Uses multiple receiving coils to sample simultaneously to reduce scanning time or improve resolution.</td></tr><tr><td>Echo Time (TE)</td><td>The time interval between RF pulse and signal acquisition start in MRI, affecting image contrast.</td></tr><tr><td>Repetition Time (TR)</td><td>The pulse cycle interval time in MRI, affecting signal recovery and contrast.</td></tr><tr><td>Flip Angle</td><td>The tilt angle of nuclear magnetic resonance caused by MRI radio frequency pulse, affecting signal intensity/contrast.</td></tr><tr><td>Field of View (FOV)</td><td>The anatomical region or volume size covered by imaging, usually expressed in mm.</td></tr><tr><td>Voxel</td><td>3D pixel, the smallest unit in medical imaging data.</td></tr><tr><td>Slice Thickness</td><td>The thickness of each image in tomographic scanning (CT/MRI), affecting volume reconstruction and partial volume effect.</td></tr><tr><td>Partial Volume Effect</td><td>When a voxel contains multiple tissue types, signal mixing leads to reduced accuracy.</td></tr><tr><td>Artifact</td><td>Non-real tissue structures in images introduced by equipment, patient movement, signal processing, etc.</td></tr><tr><td>Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)</td><td>The ratio of signal intensity to noise intensity in an image, measuring image quality.</td></tr><tr><td>Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR)</td><td>The ratio of signal difference between lesion and background tissue to noise, reflecting recognizability.</td></tr><tr><td>Reconstruction Kernel</td><td>The filter type used during CT reconstruction, which affects sharpness and noise level.</td></tr><tr><td>Radiomics</td><td>Extracting large amounts of quantitative features (texture, shape, intensity, etc.) from images for modeling and analysis.</td></tr><tr><td>Segmentation</td><td>Classifying image pixels/voxels into different structures (such as organs, edema, tumors) for quantitative analysis.</td></tr><tr><td>Registration</td><td>Aligning images from different time points or different modalities to the same space for convenient comparison.</td></tr><tr><td>Deep Learning</td><td>Using deep neural networks (such as CNN, Transformer) to analyze/predict image data.</td></tr><tr><td>Transfer Learning</td><td>Applying a model trained on one task to another related task to reduce training costs.</td></tr><tr><td>Multimodal Learning</td><td>Fusing multiple imaging modalities (such as MRI + PET + genetic data) for joint analysis.</td></tr><tr><td>Overfitting</td><td>The phenomenon where a model performs well on training set but has poor generalization ability on new data.</td></tr><tr><td>Dice Coefficient</td><td>A metric that measures the degree of overlap between predicted and real regions in segmentation tasks.</td></tr><tr><td>Intersection over Union (IoU)</td><td>Used for segmentation evaluation: the ratio of the intersection of prediction and real regions to their union.</td></tr><tr><td>Sensitivity (Recall)</td><td>The proportion of true positives correctly identified in classification tasks.</td></tr><tr><td>Specificity</td><td>The proportion of true negatives correctly identified.</td></tr><tr><td>ROC Curve</td><td>A curve showing the relationship between false positive rate and true positive rate, used for classification evaluation.</td></tr><tr><td>Hounsfield Unit (HU)</td><td>Unit representing tissue density in CT: water is 0, air is approximately -1000.</td></tr><tr><td>Contrast Agent</td><td>Injected or taken before imaging to enhance contrast of certain tissues or blood vessels.</td></tr><tr><td>Dual-energy CT</td><td>Using two different energies of X-rays to contrast and enhance imaging material discrimination capability.</td></tr><tr><td>Ground-glass Opacity (GGO)</td><td>Mildly increased opacity in lung images where vascular texture is still visible.</td></tr><tr><td>Mass</td><td>Larger volume (usually &gt;3 cm) possibly abnormal structure or tumor, requiring observation and differentiation.</td></tr><tr><td>Nodule</td><td>Smaller volume (usually ❤️ cm) structure, requiring follow-up for growth or malignancy.</td></tr><tr><td>Pleural Effusion</td><td>Fluid accumulation in the pleural cavity, appearing as fluid level or blurred boundary in images.</td></tr><tr><td>Cardiomegaly</td><td>Increased cardiothoracic ratio, suggesting cardiac structural abnormalities.</td></tr><tr><td>Calcification</td><td>Calcium deposition in tissues or lesions, visible as high density in CT or X-ray.</td></tr><tr><td>Infarct</td><td>Tissue necrosis caused by interrupted blood supply, with typical imaging manifestations in MRI/CT.</td></tr><tr><td>Ring Enhancement</td><td>In contrast-enhanced images, lesion edge enhancement with low signal/low density center, common in metastatic tumors or brain abscesses.</td></tr><tr><td>Spiculated Margin</td><td>Tumor edge with radiating spiky protrusions, suggesting invasiveness or malignancy.</td></tr><tr><td>Ghosting</td><td>Particularly in the phase encoding direction in MRI images, streaks or duplicate images caused by patient movement, etc.</td></tr><tr><td>Flip Angle</td><td>The tilt angle of nuclear magnetic resonance caused by MRI radio frequency pulse, affecting signal intensity/contrast.</td></tr><tr><td>Fourier Transform</td><td>Mathematical transformation that converts spatial domain signals to frequency domain (such as k-space to image domain).</td></tr><tr><td>Coil Sensitivity</td><td>Response differences of multi-channel MRI receiving coils at different spatial positions, used for parallel imaging.</td></tr><tr><td>Nyquist Frequency</td><td>Half of the lowest necessary sampling frequency in sampling theory, below which aliasing will occur.</td></tr><tr><td>Aliasing</td><td>When sampling is insufficient or FOV is too small, signals outside the image are repeated or overlapped in the image.</td></tr></tbody></table>',2)])])}const p=e(r,[["render",s]]);export{m as __pageData,p as default};
