This database was created through collaboration between multiple North American research institutions and imaging equipment manufacturers, containing low-dose chest CT scans annotated by multiple radiologists, making it one of the standard datasets for evaluating lung nodule detection algorithms.</p><h2 id="_1-2-lidc-idri-data-structure" tabindex="-1">1.2.

LIDC-IDRI Data Structure”">​</a></h2><p><strong>Data Content and Structure:</strong> The dataset collects <strong>1018 cases</strong> of chest CT scans, each with corresponding annotation files. Each CT is independently marked by multiple radiologists for lung nodules, including nodule location contours (boundaries) as well as nodule diameter, shape characteristics, and malignancy possibility levels (annotations provided in XML format). All nodules ≥3 mm are annotated, accompanied by physicians&#39; ratings of nodule malignancy probability; for some small nodules ❤️ mm and suspected artifacts, XML also contains records but without comprehensive annotation. By processing these annotations, pixel-level segmentation masks and attributes of nodules in each CT case can be obtained.</p><h2 id="_1-3-lidc-idri-download-methods" tabindex="-1">1.3.

This dataset was initially released at the 2017 Medical Image Computing Conference (MICCAI) LiTS Challenge, aiming to compare the performance of different algorithms in segmenting liver and intrahepatic tumors in CT images. Currently, LiTS has become a common benchmark dataset in the field of liver tumor segmentation.</p><h2 id="_2-2-lits-data-structure" tabindex="-1">2.2.

LiTS Data Structure”">​</a></h2><p>The dataset contains <strong>131 sets</strong> of abdominal CT scans for training and <strong>70 sets</strong> of CT scans for testing. In the training set, each CT has been manually delineated by professional radiologists with voxel-level segmentation annotations for <strong>liver contours and intrahepatic tumors</strong>, with annotations provided in nii volume files or mhd+raw format. The test set of 70 CT images is publicly available for download, but their corresponding liver/tumor annotations are not publicly disclosed, used for online evaluation of model performance (submit results to the official evaluation system). It should be noted that LiTS training data actually includes all cases from early 3D-IRCADb and other liver datasets; therefore, in research, LiTS should not be simply mixed with these datasets to avoid duplication. Similarly, the liver segmentation task in the <strong>Medical Segmentation Decathlon</strong> challenge directly uses LiTS data. Overall, LiTS provides rich liver tumor CT samples, with cases from multiple centers, covering different tumor sizes and CT imaging qualities.</p><h2 id="_2-3-lits-download-methods" tabindex="-1">2.3.

Each CT provides pixel-level labels for <strong>left and right kidney contours</strong> and <strong>kidney tumors</strong>, manually delineated by clinical experts based on postoperative pathological confirmation results. CT images are published in DICOM format, with resolution approximately 0.5–0.8mm, with annotations provided as masks of the same dimension as the original CT (can be downloaded as DICOM SEG files containing multiple labels or nii files). KiTS19 was initially divided into a training set of 210 cases (with labels) and <strong>test set of 90 cases</strong> (images only without labels, used for competition evaluation), totaling approximately 300 CT data cases. The training set also provides partial clinical information for each patient (such as surgery type, postoperative prognosis, etc.) to support comprehensive analysis.</p><h3 id="_3-3-kits19-download-methods" tabindex="-1">3.3.
